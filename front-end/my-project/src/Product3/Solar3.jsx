            A rooftop solar power system, or rooftop PV system, is a

            is better for the environment than utility-scale solar.[4] Most
            rooftop PV stations are Grid-connected photovoltaic power systems.
            Rooftop PV systems on residential buildings typically feature a
            capacity of about 5–20 kilowatts (kW), while those mounted on
            commercial buildings often reach 100 kilowatts to 1 megawatt (MW).

            The following section contains the most commonly utilized components
            of a rooftop solar array. Though designs may vary with roof type
            (e.g. metal vs shingle), roof angle, and shading concerns, most
            arrays consist of some variation of the following components
          </p>

          <li className="mt-[20px]">
            Solar panels produce carbon free electricity when irradiated with
            sunlight. Often made of silicon, solar panels are made of smaller
            solar cells which typically have six cells per panel. Multiple solar
            panels strung together make up a solar array. Solar panels are
            generally protected by tempered glass and secured with an aluminum
            frame.[11] The front of a solar panel is very durable whereas the
            back of a panel is generally more vulnerable.
          </li>
          <li>
            Mounting clamps generally consist of aluminum brackets and stainless
            steel bolts that secure solar panels to one another on the roof and
            onto the rails. Clamps often vary in design in order to account for
            various roof and rail configurations.
          </li>
          <li>
            Racking or rails are made of metal and often lie in a parallel
            configuration on the roof for the panels to lie on. It is important
            that the rails are level enough for the panels to be evenly mounted.
          </li>
          <li>
            Mounts attach the rails and the entire array to the surface of the
            roof. These mounts are often L brackets that are bolted through
            flashing and into the rafters of the roof. Mounts vary in design due
            to the wide range of roof configurations and materials.
          </li>
          <li>
            Flashings are a durable metal plate that provide a water resistant
            seal between the mounts and roof surface. Oftentimes, caulk is used
            to seal the flashing to the roof and it resembles a metal roof
            shingle.
          </li>
          <li>
            DC/AC wiring for inverters connect wires between panels and into a
            micro inverter or string inverter. No cables should touch the roof
            surface or hang from the array to avoid weathering and the
            deterioration of cables.
          </li>
          <li>
            Micro inverters are mounted to the bottom of the panel and convert
            DC power from the panels into AC power that can be sent into the
            grid. Micro inverters allow for the optimization of each panel when
            shading occurs and can provide specific data from individual panels.

            Micro inverters are mounted to the bottom of the panel and convert
            DC power from the panels into AC power that can be sent into the
            grid. Micro inverters allow for the optimization of each panel when
            shading occurs and can provide specific data from individual panels.
