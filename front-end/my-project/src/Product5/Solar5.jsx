            A solar carport is a covered parking area featuring a canopy made
            from photovoltaic (PV) panels, enabling efficient use of space by
            combining vehicle parking with solar energy generation. This
            innovative design allows property owners to harness renewable energy
            while providing shade and protection for vehicles.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-[10px]">
            Often, a carport with solar panels is enhanced with electric vehicle
            (EV) chargers, facilitating the charging of EVs using clean energy.
            Residential solar carports can range from single-spot designs,
            typically found in driveways, to larger commercial setups that can
            cover entire parking lots.

          <p className="mt-[10px]">
            Some manufacturers offer DIY solar carport kits, enabling homeowners
            to assemble and install their own systems, which can significantly
            save on installation costs. These residential solar carport
            solutions make investing in renewable energy easier for
            environmentally-conscious homeowners while enjoying the benefits of
            covered parking.

            Unlike traditional rooftop solar installations, ground-mounted PV
            systems rely on tilted panels installed several feet above the

            enough clearance for parked vehicles. Carports with solar panels are
            used in both residential and commercial applications, from
