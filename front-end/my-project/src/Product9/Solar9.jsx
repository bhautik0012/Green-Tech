            Floating solar or floating photovoltaics (FPV), sometimes called
            floatovoltaics, are solar panels mounted on a structure that floats.
            The structures that hold the solar panels usually consist of plastic
            buoys and cables. They are then placed on a body of water.
            Typically, these bodies of water are reservoirs, quarry lakes,
            irrigation canals or remediation and tailing ponds.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-[10px]">
            The systems can have advantages over photovoltaics (PV) on land.
            Water surfaces may be less expensive than the cost of land, and
            there are fewer rules and regulations for structures built on bodies
            of water not used for recreation. Life cycle analysis indicates that
            foam-based FPV have some of the shortest energy payback times (1.3
            years) and the lowest greenhouse gas emissions to energy ratio (11
            kg CO2 eq/MWh) in crystalline silicon solar photovoltaic
            technologies reported.

          <p className="mt-[10px]">
            Floating arrays can achieve higher efficiencies than PV panels on
            land because water cools the panels. The panels can have a special
            coating to prevent rust or corrosion.

            The market for this renewable energy technology has grown rapidly
            since 2016. The first 20 plants with capacities of a few dozen kWp
            were built between 2007 and 2013. Installed power grew from 3 GW in
            2020, to 13 GW in 2022, surpassing a prediction of 10 GW by 2025.
            The World Bank estimated there are 6,600 large bodies of water
            suitable for floating solar, with a technical capacity of over 4,000
            GW if 10% of their surfaces were covered with solar panels.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-[10px]">
            The costs for a floating system are about 10-20% higher than for
            ground-mounted systems. According to a researcher at the National
            Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), this increase is primarily due
            to the need for anchoring systems to secure the panels on water,
            which contributes to making floating solar installations about 25%
            more expensive than those on land.

            reliant on those fisheries. The impact on scenery by floating panels
            may lower property prices causing opposition from nearby landowners.
            One survey conducted with the local population of Oostvoornse lake,
            the Netherlands, demonstrated a 10% disapproval rate of short-term
            Floating PV projects in their communityThese concerns included
            obstruction of businesses and recreational activities in the lake
            area. Other surveyors showed concerns of floating solar technology

            Ecological challenges: The shading of bodies of water may inhibit
            harmful algal blooms, but the shade of floating PV panels may cause
            ecological damage via inhibiting photosynthesis and altering the
            behavior of light-responsive fish and zooplankton. Furthermore, the
            emission of polarized light by PV systems can effect animals
            sensitive to polarized light like many insects, birds, or
            amphibians.

            Floating solar or floating photovoltaics (FPV), sometimes called
            floatovoltaics, are solar panels mounted on a structure that floats.
            The structures that hold the solar panels usually consist of plastic
            buoys and cables. They are then placed on a body of water.
            Typically, these bodies of water are reservoirs, quarry lakes,
            irrigation canals or remediation and tailing ponds.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-[10px]">
            The systems can have advantages over photovoltaics (PV) on land.
            Water surfaces may be less expensive than the cost of land, and
            there are fewer rules and regulations for structures built on bodies
            of water not used for recreation. Life cycle analysis indicates that
            foam-based FPV have some of the shortest energy payback times (1.3
            years) and the lowest greenhouse gas emissions to energy ratio (11
            kg CO2 eq/MWh) in crystalline silicon solar photovoltaic
            technologies reported.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-[10px]">
            Floating arrays can achieve higher efficiencies than PV panels on
            land because water cools the panels. The panels can have a special
            coating to prevent rust or corrosion.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-[10px]">
            The market for this renewable energy technology has grown rapidly
            since 2016. The first 20 plants with capacities of a few dozen kWp
            were built between 2007 and 2013. Installed power grew from 3 GW in
            2020, to 13 GW in 2022, surpassing a prediction of 10 GW by 2025.
            The World Bank estimated there are 6,600 large bodies of water
            suitable for floating solar, with a technical capacity of over 4,000
            GW if 10% of their surfaces were covered with solar panels.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-[10px]">
            The costs for a floating system are about 10-20% higher than for
            ground-mounted systems. According to a researcher at the National
            Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), this increase is primarily due
            to the need for anchoring systems to secure the panels on water,
            which contributes to making floating solar installations about 25%
            more expensive than those on land.

            The construction process for a floating solar project includes
            installing anchors and mooring lines that attach to the waterbed or
            shore, assembling floats and panels into rows and sections onshore,
            and then pulling the sections by boat to the mooring lines and
            secured into place.

        <div className="ml-[20px] pr-10 text-[18px]  font-semibold mt-[10px]">
          <p>There are several reasons for this development:</p>

          <li className="mt-[10px]">
            No land occupancy: The main advantage of floating PV plants is that
            they do not take up any land, except the limited surfaces necessary
            for electric cabinet and grid connections. Their price is comparable
            with land based plants, but floatovoltaics provide a good way to
            avoid land consumption.
          </li>
          <li className="mt-[10px]">
            Installation, decommissioning and maintenance: Floating PV plants
            are more compact than land-based plants, their management is simpler
            and their construction and decommissioning straightforward. The main
            point is that no fixed structures exist like the foundations used
            for a land-based plant so their installation can be totally
            reversible. Furthermore panels installed on water basins require
            less maintenance in particular when compared with installation on
            ground with dusty soil. As arrays are assembled at a single shore
            point before being moved into place, installations can be faster
            than ground-mounted arrays.
          </li>
          <li className="mt-[10px]">
            Water conservation and water quality: Partial coverage of water
            basins can reduce water evaporation.This result depends on climate
            conditions and on the percentage of the covered surface. In arid
            climates such as parts of India this is an important advantage since
            about 30% of the evaporation of the covered surface is saved. This
            may be greater in Australia, and is a very useful feature if the
            basin is used for irrigation purposes. Water conservation from FPV
            is substantial and can be used to protect disappearing terminal
            natural lakes and other bodies of fresh water.This positions FPV as
            a practical approach for renewable energy generation in regions
            facing water scarcity. For example, a case study of Lake Nasser,
            which is in a region that suffers from water poverty, found that 50%
            coverage would result in 61.71% or 9.07 billion m3 annual water
            evaporation savings.
          </li>

          <li className="mt-[10px]">
            Increased panel efficiency due to cooling: the cooling effect of the
            water close to the PV panels leads to an energy gain that ranges
            from 5% to 15%. Natural cooling can be increased by a water layer on
            the PV modules or by submerging them, the so-called SP2 (Submerged
            Photovoltaic Solar Panel).
          </li>

          <li className="mt-[10px]">
            Tracking: Large floating platforms can easily be rotated
            horizontally and vertically to enable Sun-tracking (similar to
            sunflowers). Moving solar arrays uses little energy and doesn't need
            a complex mechanical apparatus like land-based PV plants. Equipping
            a floating PV plant with a tracking system costs little extra while
            the energy gain can range from 15% to 25%.
          </li>

          <li className="mt-[10px]">
            Environment control: Algal blooms, a serious problem in
            industrialized countries, may be reduced when greater than 40% of
            the surface is covered. Coverage of water basins reduces light just
            below the surface, reducing algal photosynthesis and growth. Active
            pollution control remains important for water management

            Electrical safety and long-term reliability of system components:
            Operating on water over its entire service life, the system is
            required to have significantly increased corrosion resistance and
            long-term floatation capabilities (redundant, resilient, distributed
            floats), particularly when installed over salt water.
          </li>
          <li className="mt-[10px]">
            Waves: The floating PV system (wires, physical connections, floats,
            panels) needs to be able to withstand relatively higher winds (than
            on land) and heavy waves, particularly in off-shore or near-shore
            installations.
          </li>
          <li className="mt-[10px]">
            Maintenance complexity: Operation and maintenance activities are, as
            a general rule, more difficult to perform on water than on land.
          </li>
          <li className="mt-[10px]">
            Floating technology complexity: Floating PV panels have to be
            installed over floating platforms such as pontoons or floating
            pears. This technology was not initially developed for accommodating
            solar modules thus needs to be designed specifically for that
            purpose.
          </li>
          <li className="mt-[10px]">
            Anchoring technology complexity: Anchoring the floating panels is
            fundamental in order to avoid abrupt variation of panels position
            that would hinder the production. Anchoring technology is well known
            and established when applied to boats or other floating objects but
            it needs to be adapted to the usage with floating PV. Severe storms
            have caused floating systems to fail and anchoring systems must be
            developed with these risks in mind.

          <li className="mt-[10px]">
            Societal use conflicts: Covering bodies of water with floating
            panels may interfere with societal uses. For example, covering
            reservoirs used for fisheries could undermine local populations
            reliant on those fisheries. The impact on scenery by floating panels
            may lower property prices causing opposition from nearby landowners.
