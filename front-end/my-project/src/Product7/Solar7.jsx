            The lack of an electricity infrastructure is a hurdle to rural
            India's development. India's power grid is under-developed, with
            large groups of people still living off the grid. In 2004, about
            80,000 of the nation's villages still did not have electricity,
            18,000 out of them could not be electrified by extending the
            conventional grid due to inconvenience. A target of electrifying
            5,000 such villages was set for the 2002–2007 Five-Year Plan. By
            2004 more than 2,700 villages and hamlets were electrified,
            primarily with solar photovoltaic systems. The development of
            inexpensive solar technology is considered a potential alternative,
            providing an electricity infrastructure consisting of a network of
            local-grid clusters with distributed electricity generation. It
            could bypass (or relieve) expensive, long-distance, centralised
            power-delivery systems, bringing inexpensive electricity to large
            groups of people. In Rajasthan during Financial Year 2016–17, 91
            villages have been electrified with a solar standalone system and
            over 6,200 households have received a 100 W solar home-lighting

            Solar photovoltaic water-pumping systems are used for irrigation and

            140,000 litres (37,000 US gal) of water per day from a total
